# How to run the local database

## Requirements
* Docker Desktop - https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/

## Optional
* DBeaver - https://dbeaver.io/

## Start and Stop database

In this directory are two commands which can be used to start and stop a docker container which is running a Postgres Database.

The details of the database are as follows:
* host=localhost
* port=5432
* database=postgres
* username=postgres
* password=password

These can be used in DBeaver to connect and view the database.
